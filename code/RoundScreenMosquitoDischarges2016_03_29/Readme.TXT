On both, channel 1 is the Voltage from Screen 1:1000

channel 2 (left): Battery Current measured with voltage across a 0.208 resistor in series 1:1
channel 2 (right): Voltage over battery 1:1


All tests used a single mosquito. Sometimes they got stick, and can drag down the voltage for 20 seconds with repeated current arcs and voltage discharges.
