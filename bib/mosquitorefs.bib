	Abstract = {Ant robots are simple creatures with limited sensing and computational capabilities. They have the advantage that they are easy to program and cheap to build. This makes it feasible to deploy groups of ant robots and take advantage of the resulting fault tolerance and parallelism. We study, both theoretically and in simulation, the behavior of ant robots for one-time or repeated coverage of terrain, as required for lawn mowing, mine sweeping, and surveillance. Ant robots cannot use conventional planning methods due to their limited sensing and computational capabilities. To overcome these limitations, we study navigation methods that are based on real-time (heuristic) search and leave markings in the terrain, similar to what real ants do. These markings can be sensed by all ant robots and allow them to cover terrain even if they do not communicate with each other except via the markings, do not have any kind of memory, do not know the terrain, cannot maintain maps of the terrain, nor plan complete paths. The ant robots do not even need to be localized, which completely eliminates solving difficult and time-consuming localization problems. We study two simple real-time search methods that differ only in how the markings are updated. We show experimentally that both real-time search methods robustly cover terrain even if the ant robots are moved without realizing this (say, by people running into them), some ant robots fail, and some markings get destroyed. Both real-time search methods are algorithmically similar, and our experimental results indicate that their cover time is similar in some terrains. Our analysis is therefore surprising. We show that the cover time of ant robots that use one of the real-time search methods is guaranteed to be polynomial in the number of locations, whereas the cover time of ant robots that use the other real-time search method can be exponential in (the square root of) the number of locations even in simple terrains that correspond to (planar) undirected trees.},

	Abstract = {The classical problem of robot coverage is to plan a path that brings a point on the robot within a fixed distance of every point in the free space. In the presence of significant uncertainty in sensing and actuation, it may no longer be possible to guarantee that the robot covers all of the free space all the time, and so it becomes unclear what problem we are trying to solve. We will restore clarity by adopting a ``probably approximately correct'' measure of performance that captures the probability 1-delta" of covering a fraction 1-epsilon of the free space. The problem of coverage for a robot with uncertainty is then to plan a feedback policy that achieves a given value of epsilon and delta. Just as solutions to the classical problem are judged by the resulting path length, solutions to our problem are judged by the required execution time. We will show the practical utility of our performance measure by applying it to several examples in simulation.},
